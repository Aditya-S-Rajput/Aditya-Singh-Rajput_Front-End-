There are several problems and warnings with the given code:

1. In the Single List Item component, the onClickHandler function is called immediately instead of being passed as a reference. This will cause the function to be called on every render of the component. It should be wrapped in an arrow function or defined separately.

2. The isSelected prop in the Single List Item component is assigned the selectedIndex state variable, which is initialized as null. However, isSelected expects a boolean value. It should be updated to use a boolean expression that checks if the current index matches the selectedIndex.

3. The PropTypes definition for the items prop in the List Component is incorrect. It should be PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({ text: PropTypes.string.isRequired })) instead of PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({ text: PropTypes.string.isRequired })).

4. The setSelectedIndex function is defined incorrectly in the List Component. It should be const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null) instead of const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState().

5. The List Component is being unnecessarily wrapped in a memo component. It is unlikely to improve performance in this case since the items prop is being passed as an array, which will trigger a re-render on any changes.
