The simple List component is a React component that displays a list of items. 
The list is rendered as an unordered list (<ul>) with each item being a list item (<li>). 
The component takes an array of items as a prop (items), and for each item in the array, it creates a corresponding list item component. 
Each list item component (SingleListItem) is a memoized functional component that takes the following props: index, isSelected, onClickHandler, and text.
The index prop is the index of the item in the items array, the isSelected prop is a boolean indicating whether the item is currently selected, the onClickHandler prop is a function to be called when the item is clicked, and the text prop is the text to be displayed for the item.
The WrappedListComponent is also a memoized functional component that takes a single prop items.
It initializes a state variable selectedIndex using the useState hook. 
The component also has an effect hook that runs whenever the items prop changes, and it resets the selectedIndex state variable to null. 
The component renders an unordered list with each item being a SingleListItem component.
The SingleListItem component is passed the necessary props including the onClickHandler which sets the selectedIndex state variable to the index of the clicked item.
Finally, the List component is a memoized functional component that simply wraps the WrappedListComponent and exports it.
